# Day 13 - Beginner Debugging

## Project Overview

Day 13 was focused entirely on **learning and practicing debugging in Python**.  
Instead of building a new project, the goal of this day was to **identify, understand, and fix common errors** that occur in beginner Python programs.

I explored:

- **Syntax errors** (e.g., missing colons, typos, and indentation mistakes)
- **Runtime errors** (e.g., using variables before assignment, invalid inputs)
- **Logic errors** (e.g., incorrect conditionals or loop boundaries that give wrong outputs)

This day was all about building the **problem-solving mindset** needed to find and fix mistakes effectively.

## Debugging Techniques Learned

- **Reading error messages** carefully to understand what went wrong
- **Using `print()` statements** to trace variable values and program flow
- **Stepping through code** line by line to check logic
- **Commenting out sections of code** to isolate where bugs occur
- **Testing with edge cases** to ensure the program works in all scenarios

---

## Key Takeaways

- Debugging is not just about fixing mistakes — it’s about **developing a strategy** to find them.
- Errors are part of the learning process, and every bug is an opportunity to **understand Python more deeply**.
- With practice, debugging becomes faster and more intuitive.

## Files Included

No specific project files were created on this day.  
All work was done by **analyzing, testing, and fixing short code snippets** for practice.
